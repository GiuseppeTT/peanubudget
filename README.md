# PeanuBudget

## Description

This is the entrypoint to the PeanuBudget project, which can be described by the following three views:

- From a business perspective, PeanuBudget is a service designed for personal transaction tracking and budgeting
- From a technical perspective, PeanuBudget is a full stack application. The frontend is done with NextJS+MaterialUI+TS, the backend is developed with Python+FastAPI+PostgreSQL, the infrastructure is deployed to Azure with Terraform+Kubernetes and the DevOps is made with GitHub Actions.
- From a personal perspective, PeanuBudget was an opportunity for learning how to develop web APIs, web apps, cloud infrastructure and, especially, how to integrate all these parts.
